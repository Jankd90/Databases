<h1>Chapter 6: Questions<a class="headerlink" href="#chapter-6-questions" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>Questions 1 to 4 relate to the situation at the Superclean company.</p>
<p>1
Assume that the Superclean company in Groningen shall have the use of the following table of
premises:</p>
<p>building no. address m2 customer no. name address
1054 Landleven 10 1000 1052 Hanzehogeschool Landleven 10 9747 AD Groningen
2034 Penningsdijk 6 2000 1052 Hanzehogeschool Landleven 10 9747 AD Groningen
1236 Hoendiepskade 23 1700 1052 Hanzehogeschool Landleven 10 9747 AD Groningen</p>
<p>What objections are to be raised against this database design?</p>
<p>2 2 Assume that the Groningen branch of Superclean has in use the following table of customers:</p>
<p>custno name address zip city bno1 bno2 bno3 bno4 bno5
1052 Hanze Penningsdijk 9747 AR Groningen 105 2034 1236
1123 OVVM Xxxxxxxxx 5 97xx XX Groningen 1234 2345 1001 1991 1543 The Superclean Company
The Superclean cleaning company is a business with 20 branches in the Benelux territory which
cleans office buildings, factories, sports halls and such -like. For the building (or buildings) of each
customer it is known whether the cleaning must take place before or just after office hours. On the
basis of the number of square metres and possible special circumstances, how may man -hours and
what materials be required each day for a particular customer is specified.
The cleaning is done as far as possible by a fixed team of clea ners, of which one functions as
overseer. The materials required for the work are usually kept in the building which is to be clea ned.
The overseer is responsible for replenishing the stock o f cleaning materials and places an order for
this to the stores at his/her branch of Superclean. In addition, the overseer distributes the work and
the materi als amongst the cleaners. He notifies the absence of cleaners to the personnel department.
The work carried out is checked by an inspector from Superclean, who is also responsible for dealing
with the customers and their wishes. The inspector obtains from the company’s information system
a monthly report and a summary of materials used at the cu stomer’s premises and can in this way
check whether the consumption for a particular customer remains within the norms which have been
set.
For the matters the inspector can contact the overseer. If necessary, the inspector gives relevant
infor mation to financial administration.
Potential customers can ask for a tender. The inspector for the relevant district goes to visit the
potential customer at his premi ses. Then possibly a contract is concluded which is deposited with
financial administrati on. Each branch has a planning dep artment which assembles a cleaning team
for each building, designates an overseer and provides the persons and departments in question with
relevant information.
Each branch also has a personnel department which recruits new cleaners and sorts out which
present and new employees have the capabilities to function as an overseer.
At the head office of Superclean there is also a personnel depart ment. This concerns itself with the
personnel management at the head office but also with the recruitment and appointment of more
highly trained staff for the branches, such as inspectors an d managers of branches.
The purchasing of cleaning materials is controlled centrally from
the head office of Superclean. To the companies which supply such
materials the order is given to deliver the quantities required
directly to the Superclean branches.</p>

<p>a What objections can be raised against this database design?
b Devise an awkward question to be put to this table and show why this is awkward.</p>
<p>3 Assume that the salaries administration of the Groningen branch will have the following table of
employees in use. In this there is the basic salary, the amount which everyone shall earn for 38 hours
in service, and the gross salary, the amount that everyone earns on the basis of the number of hours
that he or she is actually in service:</p>
<p>employee_ no name functioncode description basic salary no of hours gross salary
086 J. de Boer 031 cleaner 1482 10 390
087 T. Pieterse 035 overseer 1710 12 540
088 A. Arendse 031 cleaner 1482 12 468
089 T.Dolstra 100 inspector 3980 38 3980
090 V.V. de Smet 031 cleaner 1482 10 390</p>
<p>a a. What objections are to be raised against this database design
b b. An improved design is:
employees (emp_no, name, functioncode, no_of_hours)
functions (functioncode, description, basic_salary)</p>
<p>c. Fill in this table with all the values which are to be seen above.
C Give an accurate description of the way the gross salary of employee 088 can be found.</p>
<p>4 4 In the following there is always talk of two entities. Characterize the relation ship between these
entities according to the rules of notation on the previous page. (N.B. The descriptions below do not
have to be entirely in agreement with the description of the Superclean company given earlier.)
a a. A customer of Superclean can have several buildings. One building belongs to only one customer.
b b. Each cleaner is part of only one team. One team consists of several cleaners.
c
5 5. A situation description can look complicated to such a degree that one cannot see the wood for the
trees. A simplification of the situation can help to enhance insight in the problem at hand. In this task
such an approach is dealt with.</p>
<p>A dentist wants to automate his administration. For each patient he wants to establish a quantity of
personal data. Furthermore, he wants to keep track of on what date patients had received what
treatments.
There are a hundred treatments. Each of these possible treatments has its own tariff (which is fixed
uniformly nationally). Patients can undergo one or more of these treatments per visit, for example
twice for a dihedral amalgam restoration. Then it must b e recorded whether a patient is insured with
a health insurance scheme or is a private patient. In the first case bills are sent to that insurance
scheme, in the second case to the patient himself.</p>
<p>With this situation description one should be able to meet the following task:
Design the database tables for this situation. Use the following list of field names (arranged
alphabetically):
address (= the address of a particular patient)
date (= the date of a particular treatment for a particular patient)
description (= the description of a particular treatment)
hifaddress (= the address of a particular health insurance fund)
hifname (= the name of a particular health insurance fund).
name (= the name of a particular patient)</p>
<p>number (= the number of treatments of a particular kind for a particular patient on a certain date)
tariff (= the tariff for a particular treatment)</p>
<p>In this list not necessarily all the field names of primary keys are included. For the rest this list is
complete.</p>
<p>In that which follows you may first try for yourself to work out the statement. Then the situation is first
simplified considerably and is then worked up step by step in accordance with the original situation
description.
a a. Carry out the task reproduced above in italics. (Do not devote more than 20 minutes to this; if you
come to a full stop that is not a problem!)</p>
<p>Now follows the simplified rendering.
A dentist maintains a patient administration system, in which for each patient the necessary data is
established. If a patient is insured with a health insur ance fund, then the bill for a treatment is sent to
the relevant health insur ance fund. If a patient is insured privately, then the bill is sent to the patient
himself. The dentist himself designs the following database table:
patients (patno , name, address, hifcode, hifname, hifaddress)
In it there are:
patno = patient’s number (unique)
hifcode = a code which indicates whether someone is insured privately (P) or with a health insurance
fund (I)
hifname = the name of the health insurance fund
hifaddress = the address of the health insurance fund.</p>
<p>b b. Fill in five records of this table with values.
c c. On the basis of this filling in give three objections to this design.
d d. Make it clear that such objections are not to be brought against the following design:
patients (patno , name, address, hifcode)
health_insurance_funds (hifcode , hifname, hifaddress).</p>
<p>Here the hifcode is a unique number for each health insurance fund. The number 000, however,
represents no existing health insurance fund, but is used in order to indicate that a patient is insured
privately.
e e. Take the values which you have used for part b (except P and I) and fill in with these values the
requisite records of the tables from the improved design.
f f. Which two technical terms are used for the field hifcode ?
g g. What sort of relationship is spoken of between these two entities?
h h. Explain how the associated rule for database design is applied here and explain that this is applied
in the correct manner.</p>
<p>Naturally the dentist also puts monetary amounts on the bills which he sends. At the same time he
mentions in them the date on which the patient was under treatment. These matters must also be
incorporated in the database design. The dentist therefore expands his table of patients as follows:
patients (patno , name, address, hifcode, date1, amount1, date2, amount2, …, date10, amount10)</p>
<p>i i. Give three objections to this approach.
j j. Formulate an awkward question for this table.
k k. Explain that such objections are not to be brought against the following design:
patients (patno , name, address, hifcode)
treatments_per_patient (patno , date, amount).</p>
<p>l l.For illustration fill in the table treatments_per_patient with four records, of which two relate to one
and the same patient.
m. Using this filling in explain why in the table treatments_per_patient it cannot be sufficient with
patno as the sole key field.
n n. Explain why it can indeed be sufficient with the combination of patno and date.
Patients and health insurance funds will also be keen to have a description of the treatment on the bill.
Assume for convenience that there are not more than 100 different treatments, each of which has its
own tariff (nationally uniform). For simplificatio n in this stage, it may be assumed that a patient
undergoes only one of the treatments per visit.
o o. Give an objection against a table such as
treatments_per_patient (patno , date, description, tariff).</p>
<p>The complete design for the dentist after these considerations gets the follow ing appearance:
patients (patno , name, address, hifcode)
health_insurance_funds (hifcode , hifname, hifaddress)
treatments (upt-code , description, tariff)
treatments_per_patient (…..)</p>
<p>The table treatments_per_patient must now be filled in. The table treat ments_per_patient is the right
table for this. Someone proposes the follow ing, but forgets to indicate the primary key:
treatments_per_patient (patno, date, upt -code, number)</p>
<p>q q. Which fields must form the primary key?</p>
<p>The design is now complete and appears as follows:
patients (patno , name, address, hifcode)
health_insurance_funds (hifcode , hifnaaam, hifaddress) treatments (upt-code , description, tariff)
treatments_per_patient (patno , date, upt-code, number)</p>
<p>r r. Now you know the answer, try to do the complete design again
such as was asked in question 5a.
s s. In practice the dentist will certainly have printed on his bill two other items. Try to think what items
these are and why these should be mentioned on the bill.</p>

7 7. At the SCG sports club one can pursue various sports. Members must state which sports they wish
to participate in. For each member, apart from a membership number and personal data details of the
branches of sport pursued are recorded. For each sport a certain contribution is laid down. It is also
recorded whether members have paid their contributions. Possibly they have done this for one branch
of sport and maybe not for another branch of sport.
a a. Design the tables for the database of SCG. In doing so make use of the following list of field names.
In this list not necessarily all field names of all primary keys appear. For the rest this list is complete.
sport_no, type of sport, contribution (=branch of sport)
date_of_birth (= the date of birth of a particular member)
memberno (= a unique membership number)
nat (= name, address and town of residence of a particular member)
paid (indicates whether a certain member has paid for a particular sport_amount (= the amount of the
contribu tion for a particular branch of sport).</p>
<p>b b. In your design indicate all referencing keys.
c c. Give the pseudo commands with which one can ascertain:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>which sports someone pursues</p></li>
<li><p>and whether or not he has paid for them.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Once a year a tournament is organised, in which one can participate in various sports. Not every
member needs to take part in the tournament. A member who participates does not need to participate
in every branch of sport that he normally pursues. The data from the tournament are preserved. That
means that a record is kept of who took part in what branches of sport in which year, and what his
placing was for each branch of sport in which he participated.
d d. Enlarge the SCG database so that these matters are also recorded in it. Extra fields which you can
use are yearnumber and placing .</p>
<p>8 An engineering office carries out projects for clients. Such projects never last for longer than a week.
For each project it is laid down for which client (unique client number, nat) it is carried out and which
basic price is quoted to the client. In addition, it is recorded which employees (unique employee
number, nat) take part in a project. An employee can participate in various projects at the same time.
For the employees the function and the number of hours that he works per week on the various
proje cts must be known. The amount that the client must pay is based on the number of hours that
the various employees have put into the project. The hourly rate for each employee depends upon his
function and on the number of years’ experience which he has. A database must be capable of,
amongst other things, produc ing summaries of</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>all employees including their name, function, years of experience and hourly rate</p></li>
<li><p>the names of all employees who have worked on a particular project, includ ing for all employees
the number of hours worked</p></li>
<li><p>the numbers of projects which have been carried out, for which client, for which basic price as
well as the total amount which is considered .</p></li>
</ul>
<p>a Design for this office the required database tables. Use the following field names:
basic_price
client_name
client_no
employee_name
employee_no
function
hourly_rate
no_of_hours (= number of hours worked by a particular employee on a particular project)
no_of_years (= number of years of experience for a particular employee)
projectcode</p>
<p>b b. Give an accurate description of the manner in which a summary can be produced of the names of
all the employees who have worked together on project 3404, including the numbers of hours worked
by each of them.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>9 In this question one is asked to design a database for the Superclean company. As is apparent from
question 4, the original description still exhibits a lot of obscurities. For that there are the following
additions to this description.
-A customer of Superclean can have several buildings. A build ing belongs to only one customer.
-A building is cleaned by only one team. Each team cleans only one building.
-A employee can form part of several different teams. A team consists of several employees.
-Each team has only one overseer. Someone who is allocated to several teams may be the overseer
in one team but does not have to be that in another team.
-Each customer belongs to only one district and falls under the responsibility of the inspector for that
district. In a district there are several customers.</p>
<p>Design the database tables for Superclean. Use the following list of field names. This list is complete:
building_address
building_hours (indicates when the building can be cleaned)
building_no
building_size
customer_name
customer_no
district_description
district_no
employee_name
employee_no
inspector_employee_no
overseer_employee_no
team_no</p>
