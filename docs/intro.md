## Introduction

This reader accompanies the **Database** component of the course *Data Communication and Data Processing*, offered in the **second year, period 2**, of the **Elektrotechniek (Electrical Engineering) — Energy & Power Electronics** program.

The purpose of this reader is to provide a structured and concise guide to **relational database theory and design**, emphasizing scientific rigor, normalization principles, and the structured use of **SQL** for data modeling and manipulation.

---

## Course Context

The modern engineer operates in a data-driven environment.  
Understanding how to **store, structure, and process data efficiently** is fundamental in the design and analysis of energy systems, industrial automation, and communication networks.

This reader serves as both:
- A **theoretical foundation** for database design and management, and  
- A **practical guide** to applying database concepts in engineering contexts.

The material aligns with the database principles taught in *Data Communication and Data Processing* and supports laboratory sessions using **SQL-based systems** (such as PostgreSQL or MySQL).

## Structure of the Reader

This document is organized into **eleven chapters**, each focusing on a key principle or concept of database theory.

```{tableofcontents}
```

Each chapter includes:
- **Explanatory text** with concise definitions.  
- **SQL examples** with syntax highlighting.  
- **Exercises** reinforcing understanding of normalization, key design, and schema optimization.

## Learning Objectives

After studying this reader, students will be able to:

1. Design relational databases according to normalization principles (1NF–3NF).  
2. Model complex entity relationships using identifying and non-identifying links.  
3. Apply **SQL** for data definition (DDL) and data manipulation (DML).  
4. Evaluate database structures for redundancy and integrity.  
5. Translate logical designs into efficient physical implementations.  

These skills are essential for integrating database systems into **embedded**, **industrial**, and **energy control** applications.

## Recommended Prerequisites

Before engaging with this reader, students should be familiar with:
- Basic programming concepts (variables, loops, functions).  
- Mathematical logic and set theory fundamentals.  
- Data representation and communication protocols (from prior course modules).

A working knowledge of **Python** or **C** will aid in understanding examples that integrate database operations with system-level data processing.
